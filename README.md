# Plaain

Stream your media from anywhere. No server. No fee.

### Features

#### Stream anywhere

Stream your media library from wherever you are, with any device. Plaain is a Progressive Web App that runs in your browser and feels like a native app.

#### No server

You don't need to setup your own media server to run 24/7 with Plaain. Give Plaain access to your cloud provider and off you go.

#### Privacy first

Plaain runs in your browser. All the data it stores, it stores locally on your device.

#### Built using modern tools

Plaain is built as a Progressive Web App with [React](https://reactjs.org/) & [Redux](https://redux.js.org/). It uses [TMDb](https://www.themoviedb.org/) to fetch metadata on your movies & tv shows.
