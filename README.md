# Plaain

Stream your media from anywhere. No server. No fee. Plaain works by connecting your device directly to the cloud where your media is hosted. It then stores metadata to all your movies & TV shows on your device.

#### Supported cloud providers

* OneDrive
* Dropbox (on the roadmap)
* Google Drive (on the roadmap)

### Getting started

In your cloud you have to organize your files a certain way so that they are found by Plaain.
1. Create a root folder called `Plaain`.
2. Create the subfolders `Movies` and `Shows`
3. Within `Movies`, create a folder for every movie you want to add to Plaain with the movies title as its name.
4. Within `Shows`, create a folder for each TV show you intend to add to Plaain with the shows title as its name. Then create a subfolder for each season (use the season number as name, e.g. `1`). Yet one level deeper, create a subfolder for each episode (use the episode number as name).
5. Within every folder for a watchable item (movie/episode), add your source files. Allowed file types for videos are `mp4`, `m4v`, `kmv` and `webm`. The only allowed file type for subtitles is `vtt`. You'll later be able to switch between the uploaded video sources and subtitles by filename.

A file structure could look like this:

```
Plaain
|--Movies
|--|--Argo
|--|--|--1080.mp4
|--|--|--720.mp4
|--|--|--English.vtt
|--Shows
|--|--Game of Thrones
|--|--|--1
|--|--|--|--1
|--|--|--|--|--1080.mp4
|--|--|--|--2
|--|--|--|--|--1080.mp4
```

To get started, launch [Plaain](https://jonhue.github.io/plaain) and authenticate with your cloud provider.
Now enjoy your favorite movies & TV shows!

**Note:** In the case that one of your movies/shows isn't added to Plaain even though it is located in your cloud, ensure that you can find the title on https://www.themoviedb.org/ by the name of the directory.

### Features

#### Stream anywhere

Stream your media library from wherever you are, with any device. Plaain is a Progressive Web App that runs in your browser and still feels like a native app.

#### No server

You don't need to setup your own media server to run 24/7 with Plaain. Plaain just needs access to your personal cloud provider.

#### Privacy first

Plaain runs in your browser. All the data it stores is kept locally on your device.

#### Built using modern tools

Plaain is built as a Progressive Web App with [React](https://reactjs.org/) & [Redux](https://redux.js.org/). It uses [TMDb](https://www.themoviedb.org/) to fetch metadata on your movies & tv shows.
